# Cortex_V0.1_proyect
Bio-inspired modular NN architecture separating long-term memory (modern Hopfield) from dynamic reasoning (Mixture of Experts). Two-phase training with freezing ensures robustness to imperfect retrieval. Compact prototype (&lt;15M params) shows emergent expert specialization (PCA) and improved semantic similarity despite poor memory recall.
